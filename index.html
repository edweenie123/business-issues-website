                <p align="justify">Recently, there has been a considerable amount of controversy surrounding affirmative
                    action. The article, “Ivy League affirmative action case divides US Chinese community” explains how
                    Asian-Americans feel as if they’re hurt and discriminated by affirmative action in the university
                    admissions process. As such, a large group of Asian-Americans who were rejected from Harvard have
                    banded together to file a lawsuit against Harvard University. If they win, Harvard University will
                    be forced to abolish affirmative action in their application process. Despite this, if the
                    admissions process was based solely on test scores, it is likely that Asians would be taking up most
                    of the positions in top ranking institutions leading a very homogenous student body. This situation
                    ties in neatly with the topic of human resources as it brings forth the question of whether or not
                    affirmative action is really worth it. So should businesses implement affirmative action? A large
                    portion of employers have implemented some sort of affirmative action for the same reason that
                    universities do—in order to boost diversity in their environment. This is affirmative action’s
                    greatest advantage as it has been proven time and time again from various studies such as from the
                    Harvard Business Review’s “From Affirmative Action to Affirming Diversity” (though that may be a
                    slightly bias source) that diversity in a workforce leads to a more competitive business. Diversity
                    brings in perspectives from contrasting social classes and ethnic races which could increase a
                    business's customer base. However, as shown in Harvard’s current position, affirmative action can
                    also create the perception that an organization is selectively discriminating against certain
                    classes which is akin to racism. This perception may spur a negative public image for a company
                    which would decrease the number of high-quality applicants for a company. With all this considered,
                    the question of whether or not businesses should use affirmative action become a tricky one. If a
                    business is solely concerned with making a profit, then affirmative action would be of benefit.
                    However, if a competing business were to market themselves as “affirmative action free”, it is
                    likely using affirmative action may become detrimental as the best applicants would be more likely
                    to apply for the affirmative action free company. In essence, this article sheds some light on some
                    of the more negative aspects of affirmative action and considers if business should continue with
                    affirmative action in their human resources sector. </p>

                </header>
                <p align="justify">
                    The article, “Facebook faces complaints from more former content moderators in lawsuit” describes
                    how Facebook is being criticized due to a lack of support for their content moderators. A content
                    moderator’s job is to sift through content to determine whether or not it should be removed from
                    Facebook’s servers before more Facebook users see it. As a consequence, content moderators will
                    routinely be exposed to very gruesome content concerning very disturbing topics such as suicides,
                    rape and bestiality. Accordingly, there have been many complaints from content moderators regarding
                    psychological trauma as a result of their work. These circumstances have strong ties to the field of
                    management as it pertains to business ethics. The study of business ethics is vital due to that fact
                    that it helps companies prevent many legal repercussions surrounding any controversial issues in the
                    workplace. From the article, it is clear that Facebook has failed in maintaining the proper business
                    ethics; they have not assisted in providing the appropriate infrastructure for content moderators to
                    be able to cope with the psychological trauma of their work. As a result of their poor business
                    ethics, Facebook must face legal consequences. To avoid these consequences in the future, Facebook
                    has to improve its business ethics. Because the role of content moderators has not been fully
                    automated by machines yet, Facebook cannot simply omit content moderators from their business model
                    instead, Facebook should focus on mitigating the negative impacts of content moderation on their
                    workers. One method of achieving this is to take some elements from Frederick Taylor’s Scientific
                    Management by having managers selectively choose which employees are suited towards content
                    moderation. A manager should look for traits of strong mental fortitude and stoicism as employees
                    with these characteristics are less likely to be harmed by disturbing content. Moreover, Facebook
                    should also make use of Elton Mayo’s Human Relations Theory by showing that Facebook values its
                    employees. This could be done through managers constantly asking if the content moderators are
                    feeling overwhelmed and by providing therapy sessions. Human Relations Theory states that when
                    employees feel as if they are valued and cared for, their productivity, motivation and work
                    satisfaction dramatically rises. To conclude, this article provides a concrete example of how
                    different management theories can improve a company’s business ethics. It also reveals the relative
                    importance of business ethics as it helps business avoid Facebook’s current situation in which they
                    have to expend a large amount of resources resolving legal issues.

                    <h2>Production</h2>
                </header>
                <p align="justify">
                    Like the title of the article suggests, “Hyundai may suspend production at one of its Chinese
                    plants as slowdown bites” is an article that explains how Hyundai, a well-known South Korean car
                    manufacturer is considering temporarily suspending operation in a manufacturing plant in China.
                    This issue relates to the post-production phase of a company. Part of the post-production phase
                    is to ensure that the supply of a product roughly matches the demand; however, Hyundai is
                    currently experiencing a situation in which there is not enough demand for Hyundai products in
                    China yet there is still an abundance of supply for Hyundai products. In fact, the sales of
                    Hyundai products in China have only amounted to half of what they were last year. Reasons for
                    this sudden drop in interest in Hyundai in China include stronger competition from local car
                    manufacturers and worsening diplomatic relations between China and South Korea. As such,
                    overcapacity has become a problem for Hyundai and suspending certain manufacturing plants in
                    China until market conditions improve becomes an attractive plan for Hyundai. An alternative
                    solution that Hyundai could implement would be to manufacture their cars in smaller batches. For
                    example, instead of batch producing cars for a whole year’s worth, Hyundai could batch produce
                    their cars for a smaller amount of time such as a month’s worth. The article also states that
                    Hyundai will start producing their new ix25 SUVs in China. This could be an interesting strategy
                    for Hyundai to solve its overcapacity issues; the newer end models would be more appealing
                    against competing models which could once again spark interest for Hyundai, thereby growing
                    demand to the point where it aligns with supply. However, this could also be quite risky as if
                    the ix25 SUVs do not find enough market appeal, Hyundai’s overcapacity problem will be
                    exacerbated as overabundance of supply is even higher. Regarding the field of production,
                    Hyundai’s dilemma exemplifies the consequences of not having an effective production process and
                    sends that message that drastic measures have to be made to the production process to adapt to
                    the current market conditions.

                    <h2>Marketing</h2>
                </header>
                <p align="justify"> The article, “Tim Hortons opens first location in China” details how the popular
                    Canadian fast-food
                    chain, Tim Hortons has started expanding its influence into the Chinese market. For the first time,
                    Tim Hortons opened a location in Shanghai, China with the prospect of opening another 1500
                    restaurants across China in the near future. Being that Tim Hortons has only ever had experience
                    doing business in primarily western markets, Tim Hortons will have to make severe adjustments to
                    their business practices to be able to thrive in such a competitive and foreign market such as
                    China. While the Chinese market seems particularly attractive with its huge customer base, large
                    western companies, most notably Amazon, have already attempted to step into the Chinese market only
                    to find that their service has little appeal within the Chinese populous. Moreover, the situation is
                    even worse for Tim Hortons due to the recent political tensions between China and Canada. Therefore,
                    referencing the topic of the management, it is vital that Tim Hortons be able to execute an
                    incredibly affluent marketing campaign in order to effectively capture the attention of Chinese
                    interest. As such, the article has stated that Tim Hortons has already made drastic modifications to
                    its menu such as new espresso flavours and new menu items in the hope that it would better suit the
                    Chinese palette. However, this change will not be nearly enough to find success; Tim Hortons will
                    have to consider the Four Ps (Product, Price, Promotion and Place) and adjusted them accordingly
                    with reference to the differences between the Chinese and Western markets. For instance, Chinese
                    consumers typically place more value on cheaper prices than western consumers. As a consequence, Tim
                    Hortons should employ discounts and promotional deals more aggressively to satisfy the more
                    budget-friendly mindset of the Chinese. There is a high likelihood that Tim Hortons will have
                    trouble surviving in such a different environment and will have to withstand many tests and hurdles
                    to do business in China. This situation really brings light to a problem that many companies face
                    when trying to expand their business to other markets. Because different markets can have such
                    distinguishing features, it can be exceedingly difficult predict whether or not a particular brand
                    or product will be able to find success, which in turn also makes marketing more like a guessing
                    game rather than a calculated gamble. A tremendous amount of research and experience is needed to
                    ensure success in an unforgiving market like China which Tim Hortons sadly does not have; however,
                    only time will tell. </p>

                    <h2>ICT</h2>
                </header>
                <p align="justify"> With the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in recent years,
                    there has been an increasing amount of concern from society surrounding how machine learning
                    technologies will impact the workforce. The article, “Artificial Intelligence: the impact on
                    employment and the workforce” from Medium seeks to answer this question by evaluating the impacts of
                    AI. Artificial intelligence is a part of the field of ICT which seeks the development of machines to
                    execute tasks that would otherwise only be possible with human intelligence. Much like many other
                    components of ICT, AI has made a large influence on all aspects of business. For instance, as the
                    article mentions because monotonous tasks can be easily replaced by AI, companies have started
                    relying on machines to perform tasks such as customer care and document classification. Because AI
                    algorithms have been proven to be faster, smarter and cheaper than humans at a large variety of
                    tasks, employers will start to prefer hiring machines over humans in certain industries. The article
                    provides a concrete example of this mentioning how autonomous vehicles, being commercialized in the
                    very near future, will lead to nearly all professional driving jobs becoming obsolete. As such,
                    humans will have to start competing with machines by specializing in fields that are more difficult
                    for AI to replace in order to stay competitive in the job market. With regards to management, due to
                    the fact that the workforce will be comprised of more and more machines, employees will have to
                    learn to work with machines. Moreover, the project estimates that usually involves a lot of
                    guesswork in meetings could instead be replaced by an estimate proposed by a machine learning
                    algorithm. Finally, as production in most companies will be fully automated by intelligent machines
                    that handle all the logistically requirements of the production process, manufacturing and delivery
                    jobs are also in danger of being replaced. With this in mind, this article really challenges our
                    society’s perception of ICT. Typically, the role of ICT in business is glorified and seen as a
                    productive aspect of the workforce however, this article reveals and highlights the negative
                    elements that ICT, or more specifically AI can bring. </p>
